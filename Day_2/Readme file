📌 Project Overview	
	
This project analyzes how screen time impacts student academic performance and lifestyle habits using a sample dataset.	
The dataset includes information about study hours, screen time, test scores, extracurricular activities, and age.	
	
The objective is to identify patterns and correlations to help education departments design policies for balanced technology use.	
	
	
	
📂 Dataset Details	
	
Column Name	Description
Student_ID	Unique identifier for each student
Age	Age of the student
Study_Hours	Average daily hours spent studying
Screen_Time	Average daily screen time in hours
Test_Scores	Academic test score (0–100)
Extra_Curricular_Hours	Average daily time spent on extracurricular activities
	
	
📝 Project Workflow	
	
1. Data Cleaning	
	
Removed duplicate records based on Student_ID.	
	
Filled missing values using median imputation:	
	
Study Hours → 2.5	
	
Screen Time → 4.1	
	
Test Scores → 71.6	
	
Standardized formatting for numerical fields.	
	
2. Data Transformation	
	
Added new calculated columns for deeper analysis:	
	
Column	Formula
Screen_Time_Category	=IF(D3>6,"6+ hrs",IF(D3>=4.1,"4-6 hrs","<=4 hrs"))
High_Screen_Flag	=IF(D3>6,"2",IF(D3>=4.1,"1","0"))
Age_Group	=IF(B3>15,"16-17",IF(B3>=14,"14-15","<14"))
	
	
3. Pivot Tables	
	
Created pivot tables for key insights:	
	
Average Test Scores by Screen Time Category	
Screen Time vs Extracurricular Activity Trends	
Age Group-wise Study and Screen Patterns	
	
	
4. Visualizations	
	
Visualizations were built:	
	
Pie Chart: Study hours	
	
Bar Chart: Average Test Scores by Screen Time Category	
	
Column Chart: Time Category test Score	
	
📊 Insights & Observations	
	
Key Findings:	
	
Students with >4 hours of screen time scored ~12% lower on average than those with moderate screen time.	
	
Very high screen time (>6 hrs/day) showed a strong negative correlation with test scores.	
	
Students with more extracurricular activity time tended to have higher test scores.	
	
Age group 14–15 years showed the highest average study hours and better balance between screen time and study.	
	
	
	
Sample Size Analysis	
	
To calculate total students and group-wise counts:	
	
Overall Count:	
0	
	
By Category:	
Using Pivot Table → Values → Count of Student_ID	
	
Example breakdown:	
	
Screen Time Category	Count of Student_ID
<=4 hrs	101
4-6 hrs	77
6+ hrs	22
Grand Total	200
