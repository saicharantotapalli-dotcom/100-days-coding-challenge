🌱 Healthy Kids Nutrition & Growth Analysis
📖 Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between children's dietary habits and their physical development (BMI) using a realistic dataset.
The goal is to identify key trends and correlations to inform public health campaigns and interventions by Healthy Futures.

🧹 Step 1: Data Cleaning

✅ Converted raw data into an Excel Table for easy management.

➕ Added calculated columns:

BMI Formula:

𝐵𝑀𝐼=𝑊𝑒i𝑔ℎ𝑡(𝑘𝑔)(𝐻𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡(𝑐𝑚)/100)2
BMI=(Height(cm)/100)2 Weight(kg)
	​

Health_Status based on BMI:

🟢 Underweight: BMI < 18.5

🟡 Healthy Weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 25.0

🟠 Overweight: 25.0 ≤ BMI < 30.0

🔴 Obese: BMI ≥ 30.0

📊 Added Age_Group Buckets:

24–36 months

37–48 months

49–60 months
