# Healthy Kids Nutrition & Growth Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between children's dietary habits and their physical development (BMI) using a realistic dataset.  
The goal is to identify trends and correlations to inform public health campaigns and interventions.

## Dataset
**File:** `Child_Health_Data.csv`  
**Columns:**
- `ChildID` — Unique identifier for each child
- `Age_Months` — Age in months (24–72 months)
- `Gender` — Male/Female
- `Height_cm` — Height in centimeters
- `Weight_kg` — Weight in kilograms
- `Daily_Fruit_Servings` — Average daily fruit servings
- `Daily_Veggie_Servings` — Average daily vegetable servings
- `Daily_Sugar_Drinks` — Average daily sugary drinks
- `ScreenTime_Hours` — Average daily screen time in hours
- `Region` — Geographic region of residence

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Converted raw data into a clean table.
   - Added calculated columns:
     - **BMI** = Weight (kg) / (Height (cm)/100)^2
     - **Health_Status** classification:
       - Underweight (BMI < 18.5)
       - Healthy Weight (18.5 ≤ BMI < 25.0)
       - Overweight (25.0 ≤ BMI < 30.0)
       - Obese (BMI ≥ 30.0)
   - Added **Age_Group** (24-36, 37-48, 49-60, 61-72 months).

2. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - **Health Status by Age Group:** Clustered column chart to visualize distribution.
   - **Nutrient Intake vs BMI:** Average BMI by fruit and vegetable servings.
   - **Sugar & Screen Time:** Average sugar drinks and screen time by Health_Status.
   - **Regional Differences:** Average BMI and fruit servings by region.

3. **Dashboard Creation**
   - Built an Excel dashboard with the following elements:
     - Health Status by Age Group chart
     - Nutrient vs BMI heatmap
     - Sugar & Screen Time bar chart
     - Regional comparison chart
   - Added slicers for Gender and Health_Status for interactive filtering.

4. **Executive Summary**
   - Highlighted key findings:
     - Strong correlation between low veggie intake and higher BMI.
     - Overweight/Obese children tend to consume more sugary drinks and have higher screen time.
     - Regional disparities exist in both BMI and fruit intake.

## Files in Repository
- `Child_Health_Data.csv` — Original dataset.
- `Child_Health_Analysis.xlsx` — Final Excel analysis with charts and dashboard.
- `A_dashboard_titled_Healthy_Kids.png` — Preview image of the dashboard.
- `README.md` — Project documentation.

## How to Use
1. Open `Child_Health_Analysis.xlsx` in Excel.
2. Use slicers on the Dashboard sheet to filter data dynamically.
3. Explore pivot tables and charts in respective sheets.
4. Review the **Summary** sheet for insights and recommendations.

## Tools Used
- **Python Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib, openpyxl
- **Excel Features:** PivotTables, PivotCharts, Slicers, Data Validation
- **Visualization:** Embedded images for clarity

## Key Insights
- Increasing daily fruit and vegetable intake is associated with healthier BMI levels.
- Reducing sugary drink consumption and screen time may prevent overweight/obesity in children.
- Region-specific interventions are needed to target areas with higher BMI and lower fruit consumption.

## Recommendations
1. Target Region B with campaigns to reduce sugary drink consumption.
2. Improve access to fresh fruits and vegetables for children aged 37–60 months.
3. Include screen-time counseling in pediatric visits.
