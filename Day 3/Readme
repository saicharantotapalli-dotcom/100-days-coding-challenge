Healthy Kids Nutrition & Growth Analysis

Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between children's dietary habits and their physical development (BMI) using a realistic dataset.
The goal is to identify trends and correlations to inform public health campaigns and interventions.

Dataset

File: Child_Health_Data.csv

Columns:

ChildID — Unique identifier for each child

Age_Months — Age in months (24–60 months)

Gender — Male/Female

Height_cm — Height in centimeters

Weight_kg — Weight in kilograms

Daily_Fruit_Servings — Average daily fruit servings

Daily_Veggie_Servings — Average daily vegetable servings

Daily_Sugar_Drinks — Average daily sugary drinks

ScreenTime_Hours — Average daily screen time in hours

Region — Geographic region of residence

Analysis Steps
1. Data Cleaning

Converted raw data into a clean table format.

Added calculated columns:

BMI = Weight (kg) / (Height (cm) / 100)²

Health_Status classification:

Underweight → BMI < 18.5

Healthy Weight → 18.5 ≤ BMI < 25.0

Overweight → 25.0 ≤ BMI < 30.0

Obese → BMI ≥ 30.0

Added Age_Group buckets:

24-36 months

37-48 months

49-60 months

2. Exploratory Analysis

Health Status by Age Group:
Clustered column chart to visualize health status distribution by age brackets.

Nutrient Intake vs BMI:
Average BMI by fruit and vegetable servings with a slicer for regions.

Sugar & Screen Time:
Average sugary drink consumption and screen time per health status category.

Regional Differences:
Average BMI and fruit servings compared across regions

3. Dashboard Creation

A dynamic Excel dashboard was created with:

Health Status by Age Group chart

Nutrient vs BMI Piechart

Sugar & Screen Time bar chart

Regional comparison chart

Interactive Features:

Slicers for Gender, Health_Status and regions to allow real-time filtering.

4. Executive Summary

Key Findings:

Strong correlation between low vegetable intake and higher BMI.

Overweight and obese children consume more sugary drinks and spend more time on screens.

Certain regions show significant disparities in fruit consumption and BMI levels.

Key Insights

Increasing fruit and vegetable intake is strongly associated with maintaining a healthy BMI.

Reducing sugary drink consumption and screen time may significantly lower the risk of obesity.

Certain regions need targeted interventions due to high BMI and low fruit intake.

Recommendations

Region B should be prioritized for campaigns to reduce sugary drink consumption.

Increase access to fresh fruits and vegetables for children aged 37–60 months.

Encourage screen-time management programs during pediatric health visits.
