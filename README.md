Household Energy Consumption Analysis
üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes household-level data (family size, income, appliances, electricity/gas usage, etc.) to understand energy consumption patterns. The main objective is to discover how family size, income, and appliance count affect electricity/gas usage, and to identify per-person consumption, income-adjusted burden, seasonal variations, and the highest users.

‚ö° Approach
Data Preparation

Collect and clean the household dataset.

Add calculated fields, such as per-person usage.

Analysis

Use Excel Pivot Tables to examine:

For usues of below

By Family size

By Appliances

By Income

By Month

By High EnergyHousehlods

Visualization

Create Pivot Charts.
and Design Some Charts to analysis them

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
Clone or download the project repository.
Open the Excel file 

‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced
I have to take a separate clone table of particular data to analyze the charts since when I take the charts design from the pivot table, it will show all the columns.  

There is no caption for tasks with low, medium, and high incomes, thus I had to segregate my raw data by specific salary.

üìä Dataset Used
Household dataset (synthetic, 250 rows)

Columns: Household_ID, Family_Size, Monthly_Income, Electricity_Usage (kWh), Gas_Usage, Appliances_Count, Month.

üìë Reports ‚Äî Key Findings
Larger families consume more energy overall, yet per-person usage is usually lower.

Wealthier households use more energy, but the income-adjusted burden is greater for low-income families.

More appliances raise electricity use, though inefficient devices exacerbate this effect.

Seasonal peaks significantly affect overall demand.

Households with the highest usage are not always those with the most resources, indicating affordability risks.
