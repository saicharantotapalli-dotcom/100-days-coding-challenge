üß© Project Overview

This dashboard analyzes logistics and shipment performance data to help identify delays, regional efficiency, and delivery success rates.
It provides KPIs, trends, and detailed shipment insights to support operational decisions.

üìÇ Files Included
File	Description
Day10_Logistics.pbix	Power BI dashboard file
logistics_data.xlsx / logistics_data.csv	Raw shipment dataset
README.md	This instruction and explanation file

‚öôÔ∏è Data Preparation Steps

Load raw data into Power BI (Excel or CSV).

Transform in Power Query:

Merge Year, Month, Day into proper date columns using

= #date([Order_Year], [Order_Month], [Order_Day])


Create DeliveryTime_Days and DelayDays columns.

Clean text fields (trim spaces, fix casing).

Calculated Columns:

DelayDays = DATEDIFF(ExpectedDate, DeliveryDate, DAY)

IsOnTimeFlag (exclude cancelled shipments):

IsOnTimeFlag =
VAR _status = TRIM(LOWER('logistics_data'[DeliveryStatus]))
VAR _delay = 'logistics_data'[DelayDays]
RETURN
IF(
    _status = "cancelled" || ISBLANK(_delay),
    0,
    IF(_status = "on-time" || _delay <= 0, 1, 0)
)
