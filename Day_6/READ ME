📖 Overview

This project was developed for Agro-Solutions to analyze historical wheat crop data and deliver data-driven insights to farmers.
The main goal is to forecast wheat yield and assist farmers in making informed decisions about:

🌱 Planting

💧 Irrigation management

🌿 Fertilizer usage

📊 Resource allocation

📂 Files Included
File	Description
📘 Crop_Yield_Forecasting_Final_Report.xlsx	Main Excel workbook with Raw Data, Cleaned Data, Data Analysis, and Final Report.
📄 Final_Report_Crop_Yield_Forecasting.pdf	Standalone PDF summary for easy sharing and printing.
🗂 agri_data_cleaned.csv	Cleaned historical dataset used for the analysis.
🗃 Excel Workbook Structure

The Excel workbook contains 4 sheets:

1️⃣ Raw Data

Original dataset exactly as provided.

Columns include:
FarmID, Year, Rainfall_mm, Fertilizer_kg/ha, Pesticide_L/ha, SoilType, Yield_Tons/ha.

2️⃣ Cleaned Data

Standardized data with:

Yield_Category:

🟢 High Yield: > 5 Tons/ha

🟡 Medium Yield: 3–5 Tons/ha

🔴 Low Yield: < 3 Tons/ha

Conditional formatting to highlight yields > 6 Tons/ha.

3️⃣ Data Analysis

Pivot tables and charts:

Average yield by soil type.

Average fertilizer usage by yield category.

Yearly yield trends by soil type.

Includes a clustered column chart comparing:

🌾 Average Yield vs. 💊 Average Fertilizer by soil type.

4️⃣ Final Report

A professional executive summary with:

🌱 Most productive soil type.

📊 Fertilizer vs yield relationship.

🌧 Other influential variables like rainfall and temperature.

✅ Actionable recommendations for farmers.

🌟 Key Insights

Loam soil consistently produced the highest average yields.

Higher fertilizer amounts increase yields, but diminishing returns occur beyond a threshold.

Rainfall plays a critical role, while temperature has a moderate effect.
