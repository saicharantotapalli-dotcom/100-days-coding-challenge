## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
### Steps Taken:
- ✅ Removed duplicate and invalid records.  
- 🔧 Standardized **date formats** and **loan status labels**.  
- 🧾 Filled missing values:
  - Default **LTV = 0.8** if not provided.  
  - **Annual income** imputed using median value.  
  - Interest rates fixed where values >1 (e.g., 12 → 0.12).
- 📊 Added calculated KPI fields:
  - **Loan-to-Value (LTV)** = Loan Amount ÷ Collateral Value  
  - **Debt-to-Income (DTI)** = (Monthly Debt ÷ Monthly Income) × 100  
  - **Months on Book** = Today – Loan Issue Date  
  - **Profit/Loss** = Interest Collected – Charge-offs + Recoveries

## 🧮 KPI Metrics
| KPI | Description | Purpose |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| 💰 **Total Funded Amount** | Total disbursed loan value | Measures portfolio size |
| ⚠️ **Default Rate** | Defaults ÷ Total Loans × 100 | Monitors credit risk |
| 🔢 **Average Interest Rate** | Mean of all issued loan interest rates | Tracks loan pricing |
| 📉 **Profit/Loss** | Interest income – charge-offs + recoveries | Assesses portfolio profitability |
| 📊 **Active Loans** | Total current unpaid loans | Gauges exposure |

---

## 🖥️ Dashboard Highlights

## 🔮 Scenario Analysis
Used Excel's **Scenario Manager** to simulate different economic conditions.

| Scenario | 🌞 Optimistic | 🌩️ Pessimistic |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Default Rate Change** | -5% | +15% |
| **Interest Rate Change** | +10% | -5% |

- 🌞 **Optimistic:** Lower defaults and higher rates increase portfolio profitability.  
- 🌩️ **Pessimistic:** Higher defaults combined with lower interest rates lead to potential losses.

---

## 📊 Sensitivity Analysis
A **two-variable Data Table** shows how total profit varies when:
- **Default Rate**: 5% → 20%  
- **Interest Rate**: 7% → 12%

> Helps identify **tipping points** where profit turns negative.

---

## 📌 Key Insights
- ⚠️ **Current Default Rate = 8.7%** → Requires improvement.  
- B & C grade loans form the **bulk of portfolio**, with higher default risk.  
- States with **>12% default rate** need targeted recovery strategies.  
- Portfolio profitability is **highly sensitive to default rates**.

---

## 📝 Recommendations
- 🏦 Focus lending on **A & B grade borrowers** to reduce risk.  
- 💼 Strengthen **collections & recovery** in high-default states.  
- 📉 Reduce exposure to **low-grade loans (E, F, G)**.  
- 🔧 Implement **risk-based pricing** to match interest rates with risk levels.  
- 🔄 Regularly perform **stress testing** using updated scenarios.
