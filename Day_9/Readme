Project Overview

This project delivers a Quality Control Dashboard in Power BI for monitoring product defects in a manufacturing company.
The dashboard is designed to give production managers a clear, interactive way to track defect rates, identify problematic products, and analyze performance by production lines and inspectors.

Data Sources

Two CSV files were provided:

production_data.csv

ProductID

BatchID

Date

Status (Pass / Fail)

batches_data.csv

BatchID

ProductionLine

InspectorName

Data Modeling

Imported both CSVs into Power BI.

Established relationship:

Production[BatchID] → Batches[BatchID]

Created a Merged Table (MergedData) combining production details with batch and inspector info.

DAX Measures

Key measures created for analysis:

Total Inspected = COUNTROWS(MergedData)

Defective Items =
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS(MergedData),
    MergedData[Status] = "Fail"
)

Overall Defect Rate =
DIVIDE([Defective Items], [Total Inspected], 0)

Daily Defect Rate =
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE([Defective Items]),
    CALCULATE([Total Inspected]),
    0
)

Passed Items = [Total Inspected] - [Defective Items]

Dashboard Visuals

The dashboard answers four key business questions:

What is our overall defect rate?

KPI Card: Overall Defect Rate (%)

Which products have the highest number of defects?

Clustered Bar Chart: Top 5 products by defect count

Is the defect rate improving or worsening over time?

Line Chart: Daily Defect Rate trend (last year)

Are certain inspection batches performing worse than others?

Matrix Table: Defects by Production Line & InspectorName

Additional Interactivity:

Date Slicer for filtering across all visuals.

Visual interactions configured so selecting a product or time period filters related visuals.

| KPI (Overall Defect Rate) | Date Slicer              |

| Top 5 Products (Bar)      | Defect Trend (Line)      |

Insights (Sample from Provided Data)

Total inspected items: 150

Total defective items: 9

Overall defect rate: 6.0%

Some products show higher defect concentrations.

Defect trend can be tracked to see if quality is improving or declining.

Certain inspectors/lines may need review if defect rates are higher.

How to Use

Open Quality_Control_Dashboard.pbix in Power BI Desktop.

Use the date slicer to filter results by specific time ranges.

Hover over visuals to see detailed tooltips (inspected vs defective counts).

Drill down by clicking products or production lines to isolate defects.
